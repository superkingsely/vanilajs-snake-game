# Snake Game

A classic Snake game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to help reinforce essential web development skills.

## Overview

In this project, you will build a simple Snake game where a snake moves around a game board, grows longer when it eats food, and ends the game if it collides with itself or the walls. The game has been structured with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to promote good coding practices.
